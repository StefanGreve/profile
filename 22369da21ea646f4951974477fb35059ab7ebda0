Two notes here why I didn't use the FileInfo class here
to read the file size in bytes in the Get-FileSize Cmdlet:

* [IO.FileInfo]::new($p).Length does not throw an exception
  in pwsh if the file doesn't exist like in C#, but rather
  returns $null instead
* .NET methods default to $home in the path resolution unless
  you pass an absolute path or use the Convert-Path method,
  which can sometimes cause for unexpected issues if you use
  relative paths as parameters
